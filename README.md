# Simple-Display ðŸ”®

> Simple-Display is a lightweight React component library built with TypeScript and SCSS that simplifies element positioning and responsiveness in applications.

It provides three main components to enhance layout control:

- Container: Sets a maximum content width on the screen, preventing layout issues on large screens while maintaining a maximum size on smaller screens.

- Row: Represents a flexible content row that breaks when necessary. It allows you to prevent content from breaking into separate lines when placed within the same row.

- Col: Similar to Bootstrap's behavior, this column component offers props for screen sizes (xs, sm, md, lg, xl) and a range from 1 to 12. It simplifies responsiveness with fixed media queries, enabling you to divide the screen into proportional column widths.
